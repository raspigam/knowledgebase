# RasPiGam knowledge base

Welcome to the RasPiGam (Raspberry Pi Gambia) knowledge base!

Here we collect e.g. trouble-shooting guides and things we would like to share to improve the experience of using the Raspberry Pi computer in The Gambia, West-Africa. It might also come in handy for members from the Raspberry Pi communities elsewhere!

An other good example of things we would like to collect here are ideas for or notes on educational content.
