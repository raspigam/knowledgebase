# Using tindex.htmlhe Scratch Stage on screen and unplugged

![](./01.jpg)*1* Select the "shrink" tool.
![](./02.jpg)*2* Click on the sprite to shrink it.
![](./03.jpg)*3* Shrink the sprite to the desired size.
![](./04.jpg)*4* To exit the shrink mode (and return to the normal arrow cursor/pointer) click outside the stage, e.g. in the top grey area.
![](./05.jpg)*5* Click the middle star to select a sprite to add.
![](./06.jpg)*6* To e.g. add a car, choose (double-click) the Transportation category.
![](./07.jpg)*7* To find sprites further down the list, scroll down using the slider to the right.
![](./08.jpg)*8* Select (double-click) the car.
![](./09.jpg)*9* The car can be placed on top of the cat to make it look as if the cat is in the car.
![](./10.jpg)*10* To add another sprite, e.g. a monkey, click the middle star again and press the up arrow button if the sprite selector is still in an other category (we need to go to the Animals category).
![](./11.jpg)*11* Choose the Animals category to find the monkey sprite.
![](./12.jpg)*12* Add it in the same way as you added the car.
![](./13.jpg)*13* Next sprite is the bananas in the Things category.
![](./14.jpg)*14* There you go.
![](./15.jpg)*15* And finally add a crab.
![](./16.jpg)*16* Instead of double-clicking on a sprite to add it, you can also select it with a single-click and click the OK button in the bottom right of the sprite selector dialog window.
![](./17.jpg)*17* Shrink the other sprites to match the scale of the cat, then click and drag the sprites to make the Scratch screen looks like this.
![](./18.jpg)*18* The cat is in a car, the monkey is also in the car and the crab and bananas are in the upper left of the screen.
![](./19.jpg)*19* And this is how it looks like if you arrange the laminated cut-out Scratch elements on the Stage sheet. In this way you can arrange everything and plan your programming code without needing the computer yet: You can call this "unplugged programming" - have fun!
