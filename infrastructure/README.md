# Infrastructure

## Internet access

Please share experience on plans, reliability and speed here. It would be nice to list the existing realistic options here.

## Local (sometimes offline) access to online content

Using a RACHEL (Rural Area Community Hotspot for Education and Learning) we could mitigate part of the trouble from the internet connection not being reliable.
