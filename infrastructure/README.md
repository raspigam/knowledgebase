# Infrastructure

## Internet access

Please share experience on plans, reliability and speed here. It would be nice to list the existing realistic options here.

## Local (sometimes offline) access to online content

Using a RACHEL (Rural Area Community Hotspot for Education and Learning) we could mitigate part of the trouble from the internet connection not being reliable.

## Computer Lab server setup

- Internet proxy (to keep bandwidth to and from the internet low and repeated access fast)
- Khan Academy server (KALite - https://learningequality.org/ka-lite - a huge repository of learning content that can be made available offline), maybe best as separate RACHEL server setup, see http://rachelfriends.org/rachel-pi-howto.html
