# Opportunities in working with the Raspberry Pi computer

In the list below we collect descriptions of opportunities as we encounter them in our use of the Raspberry Pi computer.  
Initially it will be quite raw and unordered - we can clean it up and categorise later as it grows.

## International collaboration

Working with software that is also in use in schools all over the world creates a common ground to link and exchange knowledge.  
Sharing findings, code or projects through widely used on-line tools such as Github.com enables us to be maximally open to and  
supporting collaboration from the start.

## Easy math notation in documents

Using the built-in math formula editor of the LibreOffice productivity software suite, one can easily insert math formulas in  
e.g. exam assignments.

## 3D design

After installing FreeCAD \(available from the built-in software repository\) one can create precise 3D designs with automatically  
maintained constraints, for use in wood working or 3D printing.

## Electronics

The General Purpose IO \(GPIO\) port \(pin header\) of the Raspberry Pi allows for hooking up electronics to extend the functionality  
of the computer, e.g. adding a battery module serving as UPS, adding sensors for use in agriculture, connecting up buttons to  
create a setup without the need of a keyboard...etc.

## Authoring and facilitating educational content

Using web technologies even off-line we can start creating original educational content to support the school curriculum and build  
a computing curriculum. Senior students might help teachers/authors in its development by converting the content into web form.  
Pupils could be asked to perform an assignment on the Raspberry Pi, reducing the need for printing and paper, while making the  
administrative part \(calculating, collecting and storing grades\) easier for teachers.

## Crafts

Enclosures for the Raspberry Pi computer and its peripherals \(e.g. screen\) could be locally crafted.
