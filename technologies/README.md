# Technologies

Here we list handy technologies we encounter while working and collaborating on our project and in our use of the Raspberry Pi computer.

## Markdown

For marking up text. This is the text format often used in "readme" files and it is the standard text format on github.com.

## Git

Git makes it possible to easily, reliably and sustainably keep a version history while collaborate on (text-based) files such as
code, documentation, translations or configuration settings.

## LibreOffice

In particular the way how mathematical formulas can be included and edited and the export to pdf option turn out useful.

## FreeCAD

3D modelling, for designing (wooden) Raspberry Pi cases.

## Programming languages

### Scratch

Even though this is a graphical programming language for educational use, you can actually create educational content with it (e-learning). So if you learn to program Scratch, you are able to develop small applications for e.g. learning about certain stories, for transferring knowledge or to have some extra exercises for the ones who need extra practise.

### Python

### Ruby

### C / C++

Knowledge of the C-type languages gives you the power to build or improve core parts of the operating system.

### Erlang and Elixir

These languages make it easier to build robust appliances (embedded systems) while making efficient use of (multicore) computing power.

### Javascript

Nowadays one of the most used languages.

### Elm

A compact language with little mental overhead that compiles to Javascript making front-end web development, building UIs, simpler and more predictable, with less errors. The compiler does a very good job of catching them before they'd hit the browser.
